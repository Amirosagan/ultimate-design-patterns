# Dart Language Implementation:

## File and Folder Conventions

To maintain organization and demonstrate refactoring concepts in Dart:

* **File/Folder Naming:** Employ lowercase letters with underscores (e.g., `a_concept_example`)  for consistency and readability.

* **Refactoring Structure:** Each concept will have:
    * **pre_refactor:** Contains the original file highlighting a specific issue.
    * **post_refactor:**  Houses the improved file after addressing the issue.

**Important Note:** Files in `post_refactor` might still have potential issues in other areas. This structure focuses on incremental concept-based improvement. 

**Example:**

```
a_naming_conventions/
    pre_refactor/
        myClass.dart 
    post_refactor/
        my_class.dart 
```
